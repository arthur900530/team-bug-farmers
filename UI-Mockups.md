# UI Mockups in Figma[^1]
Create high-fidelity mockups for each of your two chosen user stories.

Note that the audio is unmuted and we see that with the icon and the text._

_Description: In meeting screen. Mic now has a line through it, says muted, and has the lock. This lock indicates that we are guaranteed to be muted right now._



[^1]: **Prompt 1:** Create high-fidelity mockups of the following screens. I have provided what the screens should look like so copy them AND add functionality to move between screens. Screen 1: [Context: user joins a Zoom meeting which launches the Zoom interface]. The screen consists of the Zoom account with a pop-up window to join a meeting and the user's preference for audio and video to be on or off and the join button. By default, pretend camera is off but microphone is on. The microphone icon should show it is on (no line) but the camera should show it is off (line through it). When we lick the JOIN button, it moves to Screen 2. Screen 2: [Context: in the meeting] We see no video but also there is a menu bar at the bottom with mic, video, participants, chat, react, share, meeting info, etc. (All included in image for screen 2). When the user clicks the mic button, it moves to Screen 3. Screen 3: [mic muted] Almost the same as screen 2 but the microphone icon is muted (line through it) AND there is a lock icon on it as well. This indicates that we have a guaranteed mute. Move to Screen 4. Screen 4: [Context: users' headphones are malfunctioning]. Lock disappears on mute button → microphone is unmuted → banner appears for a few seconds on the top of the video indicating they have been unmuted to do their external headphones. Screen 5: [they remove headphones and use computer audio]: Notification goes away to confirm that issue isn't present anymore. → Click mute → Screen 3 → Screen 6. Screen 6: Microphone is muted but now they want to modify settings. They click the caret next to the microphone → Screen 7. Screen 7: In settings, they set the volume level to be at a max. → Screen 8. Screen 8: allow screen sharing settings → screen. DONE <br/>
**Prompt 2:** For the microphone, can you make sure when we click mute that a lock also appears. <br/>
**Prompt 3:** When the mic is muted, can you make the lock slightly bigger and also not have the text "Noise removal is on. Mute my audio (...)" but instead "Muted". <br/>
**Prompt 4:** Can you also make sure that when video is off, it has the text "off". And when it's on "on". For audio, "muted" for muted and "unmuted" for on. <br/>
**Prompt 5:** Can you also make sure, when we click the caret for audio, that the audio settings popup shows up on top of the existing screen for the meeting (e.g., screen 3). For audio settings list: microphone level, test speaker, microphone (MacBook Pro microphone), speaker, and then "more settings...". We then want to click more settings which will go to a new screen that also has a popup like audio but for all settings AND the screen 3 (meeting) is still behind it. In this setting, there should be a click box to allow screen share. <br/>
